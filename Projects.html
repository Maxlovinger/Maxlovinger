                The Auto Email Sender is a code written in Python that reads a .csv file which is a list
                of emails and send an email, written by you, to each person on that list.
                This code came to be when I was working as an intern where a job of mine was to send emails out
                to websites to see if they would advertise our service. This process was extremely tedious so I
                decided to create a code to cut down the amount of time spent significantly doing this task. (Made using
                Python IDLE)

                Similar to the Auto Email Bot, the Clipboard Copier was also made as a tool to simplify my job at
                an internship. This code was written in Python and would create new hotkeys on my keyboard
                allowing me to make it so that when I clicked a certain key it would copy a prompt to my keyboard.
                This came in handy when mass recruiting on Indeed as I could copy a prompt to my clipboard
                depending on the application I got and paste it to send the applicant a message. (Made using PyCharm)

                This summer (2024), I took a variety of online courses and tutorials on web development.
                I was able to gain an advanced understanding of HTML and CSS techniques that allowed me to build a website.
                It was a difficult task because I was not familiar with the different coding languages prior to this experience
                but through hard work and dedication I was able to successfully create a website. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience
                and I only became more interested in pursuing a computer science related career. (Made using Visual
                Studio Code)

                Like a lot of my other code, my Instagram bot was made as a tool to automate parts of my internship.
                It would read a list of Instagram usernames, extract the ID associated with that username
                , and then send a message written by you to each of the users in the list. This allowed me to
                speed up outreach through Instagram which previously was a very time-consuming task. (Made using
                PyCharm)
