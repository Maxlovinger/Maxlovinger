                        My name is Max Lovinger and I am currently a student at Haverford College in the class of 2027 majoring in Computer
                        Science with a
                        Minor in Mathematics.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I've began to explore the field of web development and software
                        devleopment and
                        have learned that these are interests of mine that I would like to pursue. During my studies, I have developed
                        a strong foundation in the programing language Python and web development languages such as HTML and CSS. These technical skills 
                        have helped me hone my analystics, problem solving, and general coding skills which is essential to success in the computer science field. 
                        Apart from my studies, I have used my knowledge in Python, HTML, and CSS in various side projects focused on devleoping websites and software
                        which can be seen in the projects section in this website. 

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Outside of school and work I am a very passionate soccer player currently playing
                        on Haverford College's varsity team at the DIII level. In spare time I like to play chess, read, watch shows, 
                        coding, and personal investing.
